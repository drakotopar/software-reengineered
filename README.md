# software-reengineered

Hi geeks!

Code here is to demonstrate the concepts of the blog
http://software-reengineered.com/

In software-reengineered, I am highlighting some bad habit I have
and try to replace it by much cooler technics (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ

There is no great programmer, just good programmer with great habits !
